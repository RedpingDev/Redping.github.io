Today, I’m thrilled to announce an important update in our game development journey: we’ve welcomed a **professional sound producer** to our team! 


As an indie developer, I’ve managed every aspect of this project hands-on. But to provide players with a truly **immersive experience**, I decided it was time to bring in an expert. Sound plays a critical role in **bringing characters and stories to life**. Now, with this talented addition, we’re aiming to craft a **more detailed sound design** that will make the game world feel vivid and real for every player.


Thank you to everyone who’s followed our journey so far! Stay tuned for more updates as we continue building an unforgettable game together, with deeper soundscapes and richer atmospheres.
