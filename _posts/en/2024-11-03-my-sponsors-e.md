## Starting Redping’s GitHub Sponsors Journey!

Hello, this is Redping! Today, I'm excited to share a new chapter in my development journey: I’ve launched a **GitHub Sponsors** program to receive support. In this post, I’ll explain why I opened up for sponsorships, share updates on game development, and outline future plans. By reading on, you’ll discover how you can join me on this journey! 😊

### Why GitHub Sponsors?

Developing an indie game is challenging—especially when you're doing it all on your own. Working late into the night, building immersive worlds through storytelling and pixel art, has been incredibly fulfilling. However, to focus solely on creation and offer the highest quality game, your support is invaluable. This sponsorship is **a new journey for us to grow together** through shared support.

### About the Game in Development

The game I'm working on is a **fantasy RPG** set to release on PC via Steam. It combines retro pixel art style, immersive sound design, and a storyline with a powerful message. With your support, I can pour even more depth and dedication into the story and art of the game.

### My Gratitude to Sponsors

To everyone who sponsors through GitHub, I’ve prepared special benefits such as development updates, artwork, and even hidden storylines. I also plan to interact with our community, reflecting your feedback into the game’s ongoing development.

### Let’s Build This Journey Together!

Your sponsorship is more than just financial support; it's a cherished partnership in building this world with me. Walking this development path alone has been meaningful, but having partners on this journey would bring even more motivation and inspiration. It’s a **new challenge to grow together** through shared support.

With a love for gaming, I want to create something extraordinary with you. Join me through GitHub Sponsors, and I look forward to seeing you in the game. Thank you in advance for your interest! 🙌
