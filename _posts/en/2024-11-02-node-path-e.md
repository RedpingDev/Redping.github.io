## The Struggle Begins - Using NodePath‚Ä¶ But Why Is It Acting Up?

At first, I tried to use **NodePath** to manage nodes easily. But surprise! Even with the node specified with `export`, it wasn‚Äôt working as expected. I retrieved **NodePath**, but it was referencing a different node than I intended, leading to unexpected results.

Upon investigating, I found that NodePath accesses nodes through a relative path. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ Should I switch this to an absolute path?‚Äù I thought, and looked into alternative methods.

## Finding the Solution - Using Node + get_path() for Absolute Path

The solution was simpler than I expected. I tried using the **get_path()** method from **Node** to retrieve the absolute path. By switching from **NodePath** to an absolute path, I could avoid referencing issues.

```gdscript
var my_node_path = $Node.get_path()
# Get the absolute path instead of NodePath
var target_node = get_node(my_node_path)
```

After making this change, I was able to retrieve nodes as expected, and it ran without issues. What a relief!

## To Sum It Up‚Ä¶

Since **NodePath** operates on a relative path, unexpected reference issues can arise.

Using **Node**'s **get_path()** to utilize an absolute path allows for more accurate node referencing.

This small path reference issue turned out to be an important lesson in understanding the difference between **NodePath** and path methods.

Through this experience, I learned that even minor path references can make a big difference. I'll approach future NodePath-related tasks with more care!
