## Growing Amidst Prejudice in the World

### Introduction
The world is often swayed by prejudices towards the strong and the weak. I, too, have suffered deeply from such biases, yet found hope and grew through the experience. This journey shaped the philosophy behind the game I aspire to create. **Even in darkness, as long as we take steps toward the light, we can ultimately find hope**â€”this is the core message that fuels my game philosophy.

### Conflict 

It all started with an incident at work. On the surface, the issue seemed simple, but beneath lay deep-seated **prejudice and misunderstanding**. I tried to address it rationally, yet the other party reacted emotionally, simply because my approach differed from theirs. The situation quickly escalated as they portrayed themselves as a victim, presenting a fragile image to gain sympathy from those around them.

As a result, rumors spread rapidly, and even those I trusted **began to turn their backs on me**. They accepted the rumors as truth and no one was willing to hear my side of the story. Everything spiraled into a web of distorted stories.

Through this incident, I realized something crucial: **the world cannot always be resolved with logic and reason**. When someone positions themselves as a victim and seeks sympathy, they are easily perceived as virtuous, while their counterpart is quickly labeled as the villain. **Stereotypes** like these operate quickly, fueling misunderstandings and conflict, and I felt this all too acutely.

### Growth

This incident left a deep wound. In the midst of **betrayal and misunderstandings**, I had two choices: to mistrust the world and embark on a path of self-destruction, or to **grow from this experience**. I chose the latter. I dedicated myself to my work and **forged new bonds with a few individuals who supported and believed in me**. They saw me beyond the rumors, and thanks to them, I was able to stand again.

### Conclusion

This experience brought me great pain, yet it also became a turning point for my growth. It inspired me to create a game that conveys a message of **not losing hope even in the face of hardship and adversity**. The realizations and growth I achieved through this journey became the heart of my game, and I hope it serves as a small light for someone on their own journey to find hope in the darkness.

Through this game, I aim to convey a message of **courage and hope**â€”to keep moving toward the light even in times of doubt and despair. If my experience can offer strength and help someone overcome their struggles, that would be the greatest outcome I could wish for.
